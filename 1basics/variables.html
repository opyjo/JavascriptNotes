      //";" is used to terminate a line of javascript and becomes a statement.
      // this is an instruction to javascript to do something.

      //{} - this is a code block. which states that javascript should run whatever is in the code block.Function defination, if statement and loops do not need a code block because the instruction is already inside the block.

      // Also JavaScript do not necessarily need a semi-colon because it is run by what is called ASCI-automatic semi-colon insertion. But is best to learn javaScript with a semi-colon.

      // DIFFERENCE BTW VAR LET AND CONST
      // 1. var and let are declared once and can be changed anytime.There is no need adding var/let to change them
      //const variables can never be changed.

      //There are 3 ways of declaring a variable

      //   var firstName = "Opeyemi";

      //   console.log(firstName);

      //   let age = 300;

      //   const cool = true;

      //   console.log(cool);

      //we can also declare a variable before assigning a value to it as seen below

      //   dog = "snickers";
      // this is still allowed in javascript but its bad practise it can be prevented by using "use strict" and the console will display an error message.

      // we only need to delare a variable with a var, let or const once. subsequent change does not need the use of var,let or const.

      //2. var is a function scoped variable while let and const are block scoped variable.

      //   writeName = () => {
      //       var name = "Opeyemi"
      //     console.log(name);
      // };
      //   let name = "Opeyemi";

      function writeName() {
        let name = "Johnson";
        console.log(name);
      }

      writeName();

      console.log(name);

      //   writeName("Opeyemi");
