        //Hoisting in javascript is the mechanism where variables and functions declarations are moved to the top of the scope before code exceution.
        // Please note for varible hoisting that the hoisting mechanism only moves the declaration. the assignment are left in place.

        sayHi();

        function sayHi(){
            console.log ("hey!")
        }
        // the above worked becasue the javascript compiler takes all javascript functions to the top to run them first.
